# P2P Chat

This is a simple p2p chat program that uses threading to implement both
client and server programs on the same file. There are some cool little
additional feature such as colored prompts, and message confirmations.
Later I will likely add a TCP version, but as of now, all scripts use 
UDP. There are some basic client and server scripts as well. Have fun!
